We only provide a safe platform for people who would like to rent, buy, lease or sell their property. We can safely say that most of the listings on easyrentage.com are real. But you must be careful, as some people might attempt to use these platform as a means to scam tenants. So to avoid these, we came up with a few tips that can protect you against these fraudsters.</p><h3>Avoid anyone who claims easyrentage.com or any of its partners will handle part of the transaction.</h3><p>As stated earlier, we are not a broker. That’s why as a landlord, you must avoid tenants who claim that easyrentage or any of its affiliates will be paying part of the renting fee. We don’t and will never do that!</p><h3>Physically identify apartment or house before making payment.</h3><p>We’ve had cases where tenants pay for an apartment they have not seen physically and get scammed. That’s not ideal at all, and you should avoid doing that. Before making payment to a landlord on any rental listing seen on easyrentage.com, meet with the said landlord and confirm that the property is legitimate.</p><h3>Avoid properties with landlord (owner) in distant locations.</h3><p>Avoid renting or buying properties from landlords who claim to be far away from the said property. As a tenant if you see a listing on easyrentage.com and on contacting the landlord he/she directs you to the property but refuses to meet up with you personally by claiming they are not around. It is advisable to avoid such property, as it might be illegitimate.</p><h3>Make research on who you are dealing with.</h3><p>Before making payment it is wise to gather little information about the landlord and the property just too be sure that they actually own the property they want to lease or sell to you. One thing you can do is ask people around the neighborhood, if the property really belongs to the said landlord. And as a landlord it is also wise to gather information about your clients (tenants) before renting out or selling your property to them.</p><p>For messages, questions or suggestions, send us an email at <a href="#">support@easyrentage.com</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible</p></div>',1),G={__name:"Avoidscams",setup(H){k(),B(),t(!1),t(!1),t(!1);let s=t(!1),i=t(!1),y=E({});const{data:f,error:j}=I("/api/loggedIn",P.loggedIn);setTimeout(()=>{let e=A(f.value);b(e.message),y=e.user},1e3),N(()=>{l(),window.addEventListener("resize",l)}),R(()=>{window.removeEventListener("resize",l)});function l(){setTimeout(()=>{let e=document.getElementById("main_nav");h.screenhandler(window.innerWidth,1027,e)})}function v(){let e=document.getElementById("main_nav"),a=document.getElementById("dashboard_nav");e.style.display==="none"?e.style.display="inline-block":e.style.display="none",a.style.display="none"}function _(){let e=document.getElementById("main_nav"),a=document.getElementById("dashboard_nav");a.style.display==="none"?a.style.display="inline-block":a.style.display="none",e.style.display="none"}async function w(e){let a=document.getElementById("dashboard_nav"),r=document.getElementById("main_nav"),d=document.getElementById("sub_div");e.target.className.toString().includes("remove")==!1&&(a.style.display="none",d.style.display="none"),h.removenav(e,window.innerWidth,1027,r)}function b(e){e===!0?(s.value=!1,i.value=!0):(s.value=!0,i.value=!1)}return(e,a)=>{const r=u("font-awesome-icon"),d=u("router-link");return c(),p("div",{id:"body",onClick:w},[n("div",O,[o(x,{id:"main_nav",style:{display:"none"}}),q,o(r,{class:"remove fa-solid fa-navicon",onClick:v,id:"hamburger",icon:"fa-solid fa-navicon"}),o(S,{id:"dashboard_nav",easycoins:m(y).easycoins,style:{display:"none"}},null,8,["easycoins"]),n("ul",D,[m(s)?(c(),W(d,{key:0,to:"/sign-in",class:"",id:"signInbtn"},{default:C(()=>[L("Sign in")]),_:1})):g("",!0),m(i)?(c(),p("li",{key:1,class:"remove",style:{padding:"0px"},onClick:_},"Menu")):g("",!0)])]),F,o(M)])}}};export{G as default};
